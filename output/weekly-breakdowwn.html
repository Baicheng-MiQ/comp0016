<p>This will breakdown how our team created EyeGaze Navigator in  weekly breakdown </p>
<h2>Week 1 &amp; Week 2: Initial Research and Familiarization</h2>
<p>During the first two weeks, our team embarked on a journey to understand the landscape of current eye gaze software, with a particular focus on industry leaders like the Tobii Eye Tracker and the iMotions EyeGaze. This period was crucial for grasping the intricacies of eye-tracking technologies and setting a solid foundation for our project. Concurrently, we engaged in discussions with our client to pinpoint their exact requirements and expectations for the EyeGaze Navigator. This phase also involved delving into the codebase handed down by previous students, allowing us to familiarize ourselves with the existing framework and identify areas for improvement and innovation.</p>
<h2>Week 3: HCI Design and Prototyping</h2>
<p>The third week was dedicated to the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) aspect of our project. The team focused on sketching out and developing a Figma prototype for the user interface. This was in response to our HCI submission requirements, which called for a user-centered design approach. Our efforts during this week ensured that the foundation of our user interface was not only functional but also intuitive and aligned with the best practices in UI/UX design.</p>
<h2>Week 4: Calibration Enhancement</h2>
<p>Our fourth week saw a deep dive into the calibration process, moving from a 1-point to a 4-point calibration system. This transition was necessary but also challenging, as it required us to rethink and restructure our codebase to accommodate more complex mathematical algorithms. The goal was to enhance the accuracy of eye-tracking, making it more reliable for users.</p>
<h2>Week 5 to Christmas: Codebase Restructuring</h2>
<p>The period leading up to Christmas was dedicated entirely to restructuring our codebase. This intensive phase was aimed at optimizing our software's architecture to support the new features and improvements we planned to implement. It was a time of rigorous testing, debugging, and refining our code to ensure robustness and efficiency.</p>
<h2>Term 2, Week 6: Heatmap Implementation</h2>
<p>With the commencement of Term 2, our team introduced a triangular heatmap feature that changes color based on the user's proximity to the screen. This innovative addition was designed to offer users visual feedback on their position relative to the screen, enhancing the interactivity of the EyeGaze Navigator.</p>
<h2>Week 7: Advanced Calibration</h2>
<p>The seventh week was a breakthrough moment for our project, as we successfully implemented a 4-point calibration using projection transformation. This advanced calibration method significantly improved the precision of eye tracking, marking a milestone in our development process.</p>
<h2>Week 8: Transparent Overlay and Multithreading</h2>
<p>This week was highlighted by the implementation of a transparent overlay feature and a pause button, significantly enhancing user interaction with the EyeGaze Navigator. Moreover, the introduction of multithreading allowed our software to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, boosting its efficiency and responsiveness. This development phase culminated in the creation of an executable file, aligning with the client's deadline for the BETT Conference.
Reading Week: Calibration Enhancement
The reading week was utilized to further improve our calibration system, expanding it to a 9-point calibration. This enhancement aimed at refining the accuracy and reliability of our eye tracking, ensuring a seamless user experience.</p>
<h2>Week 9: Presentation Preparation</h2>
<p>As we approached the end of our project timeline, Week 9 was dedicated to preparing for our final presentation. This involved synthesizing our research, development efforts, and outcomes into a coherent and compelling narrative to share with stakeholders and the broader audience.</p>
<h2>Week 10: Final Touches and MFC Integration</h2>
<p>In our final week, we focused on creating a Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) application in C++ for user interaction. This development allowed for a more native and fluid user experience, marking the culmination of our project's technical development phase.
Throughout the project, we adhered to a rigorous process of requirements gathering, research, and iterative development, guided by the insights from the Example 4 website and the broader UCL Moodle resources. Our collaboration with industry and academic partners provided a rich learning experience, shaping the EyeGaze Navigator into a tool that promises to redefine accessibility in digital interaction.</p>
