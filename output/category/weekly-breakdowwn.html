<p>This will breakdown how our team created EyeGaze Navigator in  weekly breakdown </p>
<h2>Week 1 &amp; Week 2: Initial Research and Familiarization</h2>
<p>During the first two weeks, our team embarked on a journey to understand the landscape of current eye gaze software, with a particular focus on industry leaders like the Tobii Eye Tracker and the iMotions EyeGaze. This period was crucial for grasping the intricacies of eye-tracking technologies and setting a solid foundation for our project. Concurrently, we engaged in discussions with our client to pinpoint their exact requirements and expectations for the EyeGaze Navigator. This phase also involved delving into the codebase handed down by previous students, allowing us to familiarize ourselves with the existing framework and identify areas for improvement and innovation.</p>
<h2>Week 3: HCI Design and Prototyping</h2>
<p>The third week was dedicated to the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) aspect of our project. The team focused on sketching out and developing a Figma prototype for the user interface. This was in response to our HCI submission requirements, which called for a user-centered design approach. Our efforts during this week ensured that the foundation of our user interface was not only functional but also intuitive and aligned with the best practices in UI/UX design.</p>
<h2>Week 4: Calibration Enhancement</h2>
<p>Our fourth week saw a deep dive into the calibration process, moving from a 1-point to a 4-point calibration system. This transition was necessary but also challenging, as it required us to rethink and restructure our codebase to accommodate more complex mathematical algorithms. The goal was to enhance the accuracy of eye-tracking, making it more reliable for users.</p>
<h2>Week 5 to Christmas: Codebase Restructuring</h2>
<p>The period leading up to Christmas was dedicated entirely to restructuring our codebase. This intensive phase was aimed at optimizing our software's architecture to support the new features and improvements we planned to implement. It was a time of rigorous testing, debugging, and refining our code to ensure robustness and efficiency.</p>
<h2>Term 2, Week 6: Heatmap Implementation</h2>
<p>With the commencement of Term 2, our team introduced a triangular heatmap feature that changes color based on the user's proximity to the screen. This innovative addition was designed to offer users visual feedback on their position relative to the screen, enhancing the interactivity of the EyeGaze Navigator.</p>
<h2>Week 7: Advanced Calibration</h2>
<p>The seventh week was a breakthrough moment for our project, as we successfully implemented a 4-point calibration using projection transformation. This advanced calibration method significantly improved the precision of eye tracking, marking a milestone in our development process.</p>
<h2>Week 8: Transparent Overlay and Multithreading</h2>
<p>This week was highlighted by the implementation of a transparent overlay feature and a pause button, significantly enhancing user interaction with the EyeGaze Navigator. Moreover, the introduction of multithreading allowed our software to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, boosting its efficiency and responsiveness. This development phase culminated in the creation of an executable file, aligning with the client's deadline for the BETT Conference.
Reading Week: Calibration Enhancement
The reading week was utilized to further improve our calibration system, expanding it to a 9-point calibration. This enhancement aimed at refining the accuracy and reliability of our eye tracking, ensuring a seamless user experience.</p>
<h2>Week 9: Presentation Preparation</h2>
<p>As we approached the end of our project timeline, Week 9 was dedicated to preparing for our final presentation. This involved synthesizing our research, development efforts, and outcomes into a coherent and compelling narrative to share with stakeholders and the broader audience.</p>
<h2>Week 10: Final Touches and MFC Integration</h2>
<p>In our final week, we focused on creating a Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) application in C++ for user interaction. This development allowed for a more native and fluid user experience, marking the culmination of our project's technical development phase.
Throughout the project, we adhered to a rigorous process of requirements gathering, research, and iterative development, guided by the insights from the Example 4 website and the broader UCL Moodle resources. Our collaboration with industry and academic partners provided a rich learning experience, shaping the EyeGaze Navigator into a tool that promises to redefine accessibility in digital interaction.</p>                </article>

</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h3>Throughout the development of the EyeGaze Navigator, we navigated a range of technical and non-technical challenges, from architectural decisions and user interface design to adapting to evolving client requirements and exploring new functionalities. Each challenge was met with a strategic approach, leveraging collaboration, research, and innovative problem-solving to drive the project forward. This journey has not only resulted in a sophisticated eye-tracking system but has also provided invaluable lessons in software development, and the iterative process of creating technology that makes a difference.</h3>
<h2>October Update: Architectural Foundations and Initial Challenges</h2>
<p>The project commenced with refining and developing a prototype for the user interface. This phase was guided by principles of simplicity, consistency, and visibility, aiming to create an intuitive user experience. The challenge of designing an interface that accommodates users with different levels of motor ability was met with innovative solutions, including adjustable calibration points and a transparent overlay window for seamless interaction.</p>
<h2>November Update: System Design and User Interface Prototyping</h2>
<p>In November, the project's focus shifted towards laying down the architectural foundation for the EyeGaze system, designed for seamless integration into the Motion Input 3.4 codebase. We established a modular architecture, comprising key components such Facial Landmark Detection, Eye Gaze Estimation, Calibration, and Mouse Control. Each module leverages specific libraries, such as OpenCV for image processing and MediaPipe for facial landmark detection, ensuring the system's capability to capture and process real-time video for accurate gaze tracking.
Challenges this month included aligning the system architecture with stringent real-time processing requirements and ensuring compatibility with various hardware and software configurations. Addressing these challenges early was critical for laying a robust foundation for future development phases.</p>
<h2>December Update: Calibration System Enhancement and Algorithm Refinement</h2>
<p>The development of an advanced calibration system presented both technical and usability challenges. Enhancing the calibration process to support a four-surface projective transformer required sophisticated algorithmic adjustments and thorough testing to ensure precision. Additionally, incorporating user feedback mechanisms and addressing the variability in eye movements across different individuals necessitated a balance between technical accuracy and user comfort.</p>
<h2>January Update: Integration of Multithreading and Overlay Functionality</h2>
<p>January's efforts focused on integrating multithreading to improve the system's responsiveness and implementing a transparent overlay feature. The latter posed a significant challenge, as initial attempts led to software instability. Through diligent research and collaboration, we successfully implemented both features, significantly enhancing user interaction capabilities and system efficiency.</p>
<h2>February Update: Addressing Evolving Requirements and Advanced Feature Exploration</h2>
<p>Responding to updated client requirements for users with limited head mobility, we explored facial navigation techniques, integrating a nine-point calibration system. This adaptation, while improving functionality for minor head movements, underscored the importance of clear communication with stakeholders to manage expectations and define realistic targets.
Additionally, we explored advanced functionalities such as click features through the Eye Aspect Ratio technique. Despite not being finalised, this exploration demonstrated the potential for further enhancing the software's capabilities.</p>
<h2>March Update: Finalising the System with MFC Integration</h2>
<p>The project culminated in the integration of a Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) application, enhancing customizability and user interaction. Overcoming the challenge of integrating an MFC within a primarily Python-based codebase involved significant learning and collaboration with experts. This final phase not only solidified the system's architecture but also highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary learning and adaptability in software development.</p>                </article>
